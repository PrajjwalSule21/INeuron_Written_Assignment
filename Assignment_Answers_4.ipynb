If we want to add some value to desire position so, in this case we use insert method, in this method we have to give two arguments like first one is for the index value or we can say our desired position and the second is our value. According to question third position is represent by 2 index value."

In this expression we can see the second bracket having string value as a 3, according to BODMAS it will execute the inner bracket first and we get '33' in string form but we use type casting here so that '33' will became the integer of 33 and this 33 will divided by 11 so our final answer is 3, and in this given expression we can see there is indexing of spam[], and after this mathematical function we get spam[3], which indicated the 3rd index value from spam list. And the third value is 'd'."
