    "### 1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "#### Ans) There are two types of Boolean Data type one is True and other one is False. It is used to represent the truth value of an expression. like (2 > 1) is True expression and (1 == 2) is False expression , so it will give the result of given expression's in boolean data type. We can use this data type in conditional statments, in loops , in functions , in classes like every where in python if we want to known the turth value of the expression so will use Boolean datatype. Syntax of Boolean datatype is simple we have to write True or False. That's it.\n",
